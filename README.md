# Overview
The exercise demonstrates how sharing resources in a multitasking design can lead to system performance deterioration. It uses the STM32F1 board and FreeRTOS to simulate resource contention and address critical section challenges. The project implements multiple threads controlling LEDs, where critical sections of the code are managed using FreeRTOS APIs to simulate contention and critical resource management.
